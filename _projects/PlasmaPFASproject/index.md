### **What?**
 - PFAS are toxic water pollutants that are very difficult to degrade. **Short-Chain PFAS** is the most recalcitrant and problematic PFAS strain
 - Short-Chain PFAS water pollutants are unreachable by plasma in water
 - Created a device **coupling plasma and activated carbon** to degrade Short-Chain PFAS


### **How?**
 - Used activated carbon to capture Short-Chain PFAS from water and concentrate it on its surface
 - Designed a **dielectric barrier discharge plasma** to generate plasma around the carbon, promoting interaction with Short-Chain PFAS
 - Used **High-Performance Liquid Chromatography and centrifugation** to analyze results


### **Results**
- Degraded Short-Chain PFAS
- 50% degradation of initial concentration 2Î¼mol
- **Presented findings to industry professionals** in the US National Stockholm Junior Water Prize and won **2nd place**
