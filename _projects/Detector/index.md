### **What?**
 -  Made an Ag/AgCl Oxidation-Reduction Potential probe to accurately measure very low chloride concentrations for Science Olympiad Competition

### **How?**
- Used a **shunt voltage regulator** for a stable voltage reference for the **Arduino**
- Used **op amps** to amplify the signal from the electrodes
- Created a stable **Ag/AgCl reference electrode** with an agar salt bridge
- Calibrated the detector with a voltage vs. concentration model

### **Results**
- Won 2nd in the Princeton Invitational
- Won 4th in the PA State Competition
