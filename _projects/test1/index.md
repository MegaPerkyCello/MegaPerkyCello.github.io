### **What?**
 - Plasma generators produce a tiny volume of plasma and have a geometry that hinders treatment
 - Developed plasma generator that can be molded into any shape and produce a large volume of plasma, enabling sterilization of foods

### **How?**
- Used **Fusion 360** to model a gas distributor that is readily customizable in shape and **3D-printed** it
- Designed a RF pulse-oscillator circuit on **Altium Designer** to drive a flyback transformer and power the device
